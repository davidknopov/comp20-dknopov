What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)

The purpose of this Git repository is to update and have a collection of all ( or most ) of the assignments we have done in this course.

What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
My favorite assignment was 2 and 3 because it was really interesting to create the server side and the client side
of not uber. It taught me a little more about how the web works and how a server sends and recieves data. I loved 
looking at my not uber connected to my server because I knew everything in this program from the server to the client
was written by me.


How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
I think I have grown a reasonable amount. I learned a lot about the Web and became a more 
experienced coder. I think there were a lot of real world applications in this class and 
I attribute that to my growth.


What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

1. I learned what happens when you type google into the web browser.

2. NEVER TRUST THE USER INPUT 


Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

Databases.
